Current progress:
1. Created a simple standard embedding -> LSTM -> linear network. 
The performance of the network is standard, nothing fance. It generates syntaxturely correct sentense and nothing more. 
2. Created a simple web front end. The front end can get simple request character to start.

Current problems:
1. the first line of the text is garbage for some reason. 
2. lack input validation
3. lack writing prompt for the network.

Future works: 
1. Use GPT-2 from open AI and transfer learning to generate higher quality content. 
2. Use deep fake to generate character performance. 
3. Start my own Youtube channel. (hehe)
